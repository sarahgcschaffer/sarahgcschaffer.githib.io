<h1>My Work<h1>
  <h2 id="site-head">This Website</h2>
<div class="site">
    <img class="expand" id="webshot" src="images/webshot.png" alt="picture of website homepage">
    <p id="webshot-desc">Yes! I coded this entire website myself, no website builders involved. All of what you are seeing is HTML and CSS.
      I hope to include another language such as JavaScript or PHP for more interactivity.<br><br>
      Does the picture on the left not look like what you see? To see a cool feature, try switching your display mode from light to dark or vice versa.</p>

  <h2>My Logo</h2>
<div class="logo">
    <p id="logo-desc">My logo is also self-produced. I made it in Illustrator back in 2019 when I was still in high school.
      It is among some of the first things I created while learning Illustrator. While simple, my logo is still something I am proud of.</p>

  <h2>Hy-Vee Dietitian Webpage</h2>
    <p>During my internship with Hy-Vee, I worked closely with the dietitians and realized their website was in desperate need of a tune-up.<br><br>In under 48 hours, I put together
      a draft with HTML and CSS that would do what it could in their outdated system. I focused on condensing information, making the top banner more inviting, and using
      more teal to adhere to the Hy-Vee dietitian brand standards.

  <h2>Club Social Media</h2>
    <p>I run the Instagram account for the Iowa State Sports Media Club. You can visit our page <a href="https://www.instagram.com/isusportsmedia/">here</a>.
      I edit the template for weekly meetings in Photoshop and produce all the content myself.<br><br>
      Additionally, I am currently working on a website for the club.<p>

  <h2>ADVRT 336: Iowa DOT and Bucket Media</h2>
    <p>The following are all part of a campaign my team created for the Iowa DOT with Bucket Media advertising agency.
      The idea of the campaign was to encourage safe driving and disuade people from texting and driving.<br><br>
      Most of the campaign was done in under three weeks, so a lot of the creative is conceptual and unpolished due to time constraints.
      My team competed against all the other teams in the class and won the spot of best campign.</p>

  <h2>ADVRT 434: Mountain Dew Energy</h2>
    <p>These pieces are part of a campaign still in development. Mountain Dew Energy, previously Mountain Dew Rise before some legal issues, is looking for new digital media ideas from out class.<br><br>
      My team, which I lead, is still working on refining all aspects of our campaign and conducting a second round of primary research. I made the first two pieces in Photoshop and the last one in Canva.</p>

  <h2>Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union</h2>
<div class="ighsau">
    <p>While I was in Waukee's APEX program, I was placed on a project editing a series of short highlights for notable young women in athletics.
      I had little to no contact with the client and the team capturing the footage, so it was difficult to get the shots I needed. I learned a lot about the importance of B Roll while editing in Final Cut.</p>
